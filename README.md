# Dual-Heap-Sorting-Algorithm
A project started in June of 2019. Goal: to incorporate two rounds of heap sorting algorithms into one program to examine the efficiency of reverse consolidation in general sorting applications. Three files included: dualheap is the final product while testsort is the testing file and heapsort is my interpretation of the conventional heap sort algorithm.
